    <h1>Playroll</h1>
    <p>
      Playroll is a small startup/side project I am currently involved in with
      both Computer Science and Entrepreneurship students at LMU. The mobile
      app aims to change the way music playlists are created and shared.
      Front-end development is done entirely in React Native, and the back-end
      polls the Spotify API in Go using GraphQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm heading the front-end design and implementation of the app,
      troubleshooting others' React Native troubles and putting out screens of
      my own. This is all according to spec I created using the InVision app
      for wireframing. While I have plans to move onto working on the
      back-end, I am currently pushing to have a beta app release by April and
      am focusing all of my efforts into finalizing front-end components.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the creators of Playroll and the nature of startups with
      investors, I don't currently have links available for you to check out,
      so I've gone ahead and attached some screen recordings of the app that
      are WIP.

    <h1>Nebula VR</h1>
    <p>
      Nebula VR is a virtual reality IDE used for the visual scripting
      language Nebula. The IDE was developed in Unity for the HTC Vive and was
      developed for LMU's CMSI 401: Software Engineering Laboratory course. It
      takes the coordinates of game objects within the environment and
      translates that to the Nebula Javascript compiler, then sends the output
      back to the VR environment. This is communicated through the MVVM
      (model-view-viewmodel) architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I headed the "view" aspect of this project, working solely on the Unity
      side. I designed the interactions between function/variable blocks (see
      presentation linked below) including spawning blocks, grabbing blocks,
      and linking blocks together. I wrote a large part of the Unity C# of
      this project and was happy to have such a new topic like virtual reality
      be my introduction to collaborative software engineering.

    <h1>casper</h1>

    <p>
      "casper" is a scripting language designed for LMU's CMSI 488: Language
      Translation and Implementation (aka Compilers) course of Spring 2019.
      The language's is built using Ohm, compiled to Javascript, and tested
      using Mocha and ESLint. The Ohm grammar along with parser tests are
      available on the GitHub repo, and abstract syntax trees and semantic
      analysis is on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "casper" is statically typed and includes partial type inference,
      parallel variable declaration and assignment, higher order functions,
      and optional parameters. It takes inspiration from Python and Typescript
      to create a clean-looking interview language to practice in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am the working project manager and am currently finalizing
      the grammar and developing the abstract syntax trees for the language.
    </p>

    <h1>LMU Esports</h1>
    <p>
      I've been the LMU Esports vice president since its founding in 2016.
      Over the course of Summer 2019, I did a rebranding of the club in its
      entirety to encourage funding from the school and other potential
      sponsors. The result is a new website along with a fresh logo, along
      with an affiliation to purchase jerseys designed by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admittedly there isn't anything generally special about this site, but
      it is one that I put together on my own and am proud of some of the
      design features in the site, logo, and jerseys. I hope it serves as a
      decent example of my ability to put together a website.

    <h1>K'two</h1>
    <p>Kâ€™two is a 1-4 player, browser-based, online multiplayer, class-based,
      zombie wave survival game. It's the sequel to a game built by an LMU
      Computer Science professor 8 years ago: K'tah for the same course said 
      professor attended here, CMSI 402: Senior Project Laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      K'two is another Unity project I'm working on; this time out of the
      virtual reality space. This time I'm in a smaller group and am focusing
      heavily on the networking and game design aspects. Although this project 
      is still a work in progress, we've already gone through multiple iterations 
      of multiplayer implementations such as WebSocket and Socket.IO. We're beginning 
      to settle on a TCP client-server model through Unity itself, but I'll be 
      sure to update on the final plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only do I think this is a cool homage to our professor at LMU, but 
      I find this an interesting way to apply skills and knowledge of networking. 
      Multiplayer games are an integral part to today's entertainment and learning 
      how to handle over thirty clients on my product at once seems like an interesting 
      challenge.

    <h1>Kirkman</h1>
    <p>I haven't had time to put this up yet, but a few members of LMU Computer Science
      have formed a cult following around this fun little problem. I intend to not only post 
      my solution, but also analyze solutions faster than mine and their implementations of 
      data structures along with derivations of algorithms that have been built upon over 
      the past few years.
