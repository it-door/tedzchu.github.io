      <h1>Playroll</h1>
      <p>
        Playroll is a small startup/side project I am currently involved in with
        both Computer Science and Entrepreneurship students at LMU. The mobile
        app aims to change the way music playlists are created and shared.
        Front-end development is done entirely in React Native, and the back-end
        polls the Spotify API in Go using GraphQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm heading the front-end design and implementation of the app,
        troubleshooting others' React Native troubles and putting out screens of
        my own. This is all according to spec I created using the InVision app
        for wireframing. While I have plans to move onto working on the
        back-end, I am currently pushing to have a beta app release by April and
        am focusing all of my efforts into finalizing front-end components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the creators of Playroll and the nature of startups with
        investors, I don't currently have links available for you to check out,
        so I've gone ahead and attached some screen recordings of the app that
        are WIP.

      <h1>Nebula VR</h1>
      <p>
        Nebula VR is a virtual reality IDE used for the visual scripting
        language Nebula. The IDE was developed in Unity for the HTC Vive and was
        developed for LMU's CMSI 401: Software Engineering Laboratory course. It
        takes the coordinates of game objects within the environment and
        translates that to the Nebula Javascript compiler, then sends the output
        back to the VR environment. This is communicated through the MVVM
        (model-view-viewmodel) architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I headed the "view" aspect of this project, working solely on the Unity
        side. I designed the interactions between function/variable blocks (see
        presentation linked below) including spawning blocks, grabbing blocks,
        and linking blocks together. I wrote a large part of the Unity C# of
        this project and was happy to have such a new topic like virtual reality
        be my introduction to collaborative software engineering.

      <h1>casper</h1>

      <p>
        "casper" is a scripting language designed for LMU's CMSI 488: Language
        Translation and Implementation (aka Compilers) course of Spring 2019.
        The language's is built using Ohm, compiled to Javascript, and tested
        using Mocha and ESLint. The Ohm grammar along with parser tests are
        available on the GitHub repo, and abstract syntax trees and semantic
        analysis is on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        "casper" is statically typed and includes partial type inference,
        parallel variable declaration and assignment, higher order functions,
        and optional parameters. It takes inspiration from Python and Typescript
        to create a clean-looking interview language to practice in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am the working project manager and am currently finalizing
        the grammar and developing the abstract syntax trees for the language.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been the LMU Esports vice president since its founding in 2016.
        Over the course of Summer 2019, I did a rebranding of the club in its
        entirety to encourage funding from the school and other potential
        sponsors. The result is a new website along with a fresh logo, along
        with an affiliation to purchase jerseys designed by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Admittedly there isn't anything generally special about this site, but
        it is one that I put together on my own and am proud of some of the
        design features in the site, logo, and jerseys. I hope it serves as a
        decent example of my ability to put together a website.
